This is a really dumb, but working, example of how to generate a create table statement from delimited data. In this case, it's from the American Community Survey. 

> python parse_census2.py

That should create a text file (with sql in it) called schema_parsed.txt

Create a table with

psql -U username -d database < schema_parsed.txt 

Then copy the table in (you may have to first erase the first row of table headers) with a copy table statement.
